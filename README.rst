Package Description
===================

**QConnectWinapp** is an extension for the **Robot Framework** keyword library **QConnectBase** and designed to simplify and automate
Windows application GUI testing. **QConnectWinapp** is built to provide seamless and efficient GUI testing experiences for Windows applications.

Prerequisites
-------------

To use **QConnectWinapp**, the following applications must be installed before:

* `WinAppDriver <https://github.com/Microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases>`__ (version >= 1.2.1)
* `Windows SDK <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/>`__

How to install
--------------

The **QConnectWinapp** can be installed in two different ways.

1. Installation via PyPi (recommended for users)

   .. code::

      pip install robotframework-qconnect-winapp

   `QConnectWinapp in PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/robotframework-qconnect-winapp/>`_

2. Installation via GitHub (recommended for developers)

   * Clone the **robotframework-qconnect-winapp** repository to your machine.

     .. code::

        git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-qconnect-winapp.git

     `QConnectWinapp in GitHub <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/robotframework-qconnect-winapp>`_

   * Use the following command to install **QConnectWinapp** (executed in repository main folder):

     .. code::

        python -m pip install .

     Or:

     .. code::

        python -m pip install --proxy <proxy> .

     This command will also download and install all dependencies that are required to work with the source files in the current repository.
     After the initial installation of **QConnectWinapp** is done, you have the following two possibilities:

     1. *Clean the previous installation*:

        .. code::

           python "./cleanup_installation.py"

        ``cleanup_installation.py`` explicitly deletes all files and folders within the component installation folder under
        ``site-packages`` and also deletes local build artefacts.

     2. *Render the component documentation*:

        .. code::

           python "./genpackagedoc.py"

        This would e.g. be required in case of changes in the interface of **QConnectWinapp**.

        The documentation is rendered by a separate application called **GenPackageDoc**, that is part
        of the build dependencies and runtime dependencies of **QConnectWinapp**.

        **GenPackageDoc** needs to be configured. Details about how to do this, can be found in the
        `README.rst <https://github.com/test-fullautomation/python-genpackagedoc/blob/develop/README.rst>`_
        (sections *Install dependencies* and *Configure dependencies*).

   * Use the following command to build **QConnectWinapp** (executed in repository main folder):

     .. code::

        python -m build .

     Or:

     .. code::

        python -m pip config set global.proxy <proxy>
        python -m build .
